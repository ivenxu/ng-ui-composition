## Monolithic frontend
It's quite common when people talking microservices, they just talking about services only. A common microservices architecture is many discrete API services + a gateway + a monolithic frontend. This is not ideal - "[With a monolithic frontend you never get the flexibility to scale across teams as promised by microservices.](http://blog.xebia.com/the-monolithic-frontend-in-the-microservices-architecture/)".
